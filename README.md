# final-assignment-320

designed and deployed a casino game using Qt creator and C++

- Game was designed in a group of 6 and focussed on solid design principles and development techniques
- Documentation was done on confluence and task generation/assignment was given on Jira
- Final uploads were pushed to BitBucket 

My personal contributions to this project (in terms of code) was the blackjack backend (blackjack.cpp and blackjack.h)
